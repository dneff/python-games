### Marco Polo

First pass at converting a game from circa 1985 BASIC to Python.

Observations in conversion:

- important of input validation
- value of helper functions
- challenge of capturing logic/mechanics using naked variable manipulation (is higher health good or bad?)

TODO:

- [ ] move helper functions into resource file
- [ ] move 'Traveler' class into file
- [ ] create 'Map' class
- [ ] move functions to resource, Traveler, Map as needed
