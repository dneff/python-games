The Journey of Marco Polo: 1271

Starting from Venice in 1271 you travel by sailing ship to the
port of Armenia. Upon arrival, you prepare for the 6000 mile trek to
the cour of the Great Kublai Khan in Shang-tu, Cathay. Having set
aside $JEWELS$ precious jewels to finance your planned 3-year trip,
you must barter for the following supplies in Armenia:

    * Camels
    (Sturdier animals will cost more. You will probably want 8-10 camels)

    * Food
    (You must barter for food as you travel along. However prices
    tend to be lower in port cities, so you should pack in a good
    supply at the start)

    * Oil for lamps and cooking
    (Over much of the trip, you will be able to use wood to build fires.
    However, in the Persian, Lop, and Gobi deserts you will need oil.)

and medicines (balms and unguents); however your provisions will be
depleted as you go along and you must replenish them. The selection
and price of supplies is quite different in various regions, so you
must barter wisely. As a merchant, you are not skilled in fishing or
hunting, although occasionally you might be able to try to get some
food in this way.
